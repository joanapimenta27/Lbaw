                    <p>Flick was born out of the need for a platform that allows people to connect freely and choose what they want to share with the public and what they want to keep in a smaller circle. Weâ€™re here to create a space where every moment matters and where your account doesn't need to be exclusively public or private, it can be a bit of both.</p>
